Queen Hel

Queen Hel from the Norse pantheon, for me at least, is a deity that is both half dead and half alive. 
She is a chthonic deity but that could also mean she is a deity of liminal spaces, boundaries and travel between realms. 
She can represent what most witches call “shadow work”. Being a deity of liminal spaces she is also a deity of “grey areas” 
in a sense that nothing is black and white. I’m still working on my issues with binary thinking, but I’m constantly reminded 
by other magick practitioners and pagans in general of the complexity of life.
